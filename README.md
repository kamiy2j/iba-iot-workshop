<br/><br/>
*Additional gateway information is available at https://github.com/wokwi/wokwigw (not required for the workshop)*
<br/><br/>

### Simulation Setup
Now let's set up your personal patient monitoring system:

1. Open our Wokwi project template: https://wokwi.com/projects/427997258929717249

2. Create your own copy by clicking the dropdown arrow in the top-left corner, then ***Save a copy*** followed by ***Save copy***. This ensures your changes won't affect other participants.

Replace **John Doe** and **patient001** with your name and ID.<br/><br/>

5. Launch your simulation by clicking the green "Start the simulation" button. Your patient monitoring dashboard will initialize and display vital signs.

<br/><br/>
<img width="1051" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-21 at 4 00 18‚ÄØAM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9260ef-ddb2-4588-8b1e-9a8e142a8980" />
<br/><br/>
These are the different sensors, where you can increase or decrease the simulated vital signs just by moving these knobs clock or anti-clock wise.

### üñ•Ô∏è Server Setup
Now that your patient monitoring device is operational, let's set up the server infrastructure to collect, store, and visualize the vital signs data:

1. **Install Docker Desktop**
   - Download Docker Desktop from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Follow the installation instructions for Windows
   - Ensure Docker is running before proceeding to the next step

2. **Download Workshop Files**
   - Download the workshop files from: [link to workshop files]
   - Extract the ZIP file to a convenient location on your computer
   - Open a command prompt in the extracted folder

3. **Start the Server Infrastructure**
   - Run the following command to start all required services:
     ```
     docker-compose up -d
     ```
   - This will initialize:
     - EMQX (MQTT broker) - Receives data from patient monitoring devices
     - InfluxDB - Time-series database for storing medical data
     - Telegraf - Data collection agent
     - Grafana - Visualization platform for medical dashboards

4. **Verify Services**
   - EMQX Dashboard: http://localhost:18083 (Username: admin, Password: public)
   - InfluxDB Interface: http://localhost:8086 (Username: admin, Password: adminpass)
   - Grafana Dashboard: http://localhost:3000 (Username: admin, Password: admin)

5. **Connect Your Patient Monitor**
   - Your simulated patient monitor will automatically connect to the MQTT broker
   - Data flow: Patient Monitor ‚Üí MQTT ‚Üí InfluxDB ‚Üí Grafana
   - The MQTT topic format is: `medical/{patient_id}/vitals`

### üìä Data Visualization
Access your personalized patient dashboard:

1. Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000
2. Log in with username `admin` and password `admin` (you'll be prompted to change this on first login)
3. Navigate to Dashboards ‚Üí Patient Monitoring
4. Select your patient ID from the dropdown to view your personalized dashboard



For this workshop, we've simplified some security aspects, but in a production environment, these considerations would be fully implemented.
## üõ°Ô∏è Compliance

Ensuring compliance with international and local regulations is a critical component of our healthcare IoT system. This section outlines how our Wokwi simulation and infrastructure align with key standards:

### üìã Key Regulatory Standards

- **ISO 27001**  
  International standard for information security management. It ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and availability ‚Äî especially crucial for transmitting patient data over networks.

- **ISO 27799**  
  Tailored for healthcare, this standard extends ISO 27001 by addressing the specific security needs of medical environments like hospitals and clinics.

- **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**  
  U.S. regulation protecting patient health information (PHI). It emphasizes encryption, audit logging, and strict access controls.

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**  
  European regulation that champions user data privacy and consent. Essential if any patient-identifiable information is involved.

- **HL7 & FHIR**  
  Standards for exchanging healthcare information electronically. They facilitate smooth, secure integration with hospital databases.

### üß© Compliance in Practice: Our Wokwi IoT Project

- **üîê Secure Transmission**  
  Patient vitals and other sensor data are transmitted via TLS-encrypted channels, fulfilling ISO 27001 and HIPAA transmission security mandates.

- **üìÑ Audit Logging & Data Integrity**  
  Every data packet is timestamped and logged in the cloud, enabling traceability in line with HIPAA and GDPR requirements.

- **üîë Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
  Access to Grafana dashboards is limited based on user roles (e.g., doctors, admins), enforcing ISO 27799 and HIPAA‚Äôs least privilege principle.

- **üïµÔ∏è Anonymization by Design**  
  Even simulated datasets are anonymized to uphold GDPR‚Äôs privacy-by-design philosophy.

- **üìä Real-Time Alerts & Monitoring**  
  Grafana alerts on abnormal vitals are logged, enabling proactive risk management and ongoing compliance auditing.
