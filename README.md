<br/><br/>

### Install Wokwi Private Gateway
To ensure reliable connectivity during the workshop simulation, we'll use the Wokwi Private Gateway. 

1. Download the gateway application (***wokwigw.exe***) from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BgdI2S2ggcG5d6DtUcaOdjBLsbAlhyiJ/view?usp=sharing
2. Run the downloaded file. You should see this confirmation screen indicating successful installation:

<br/><br/>
*Additional gateway information is available at https://github.com/wokwi/wokwigw (not required for the workshop)*
<br/><br/>

### Simulation Setup
Now let's set up your personal patient monitoring system:

1. Open our Wokwi project template: https://wokwi.com/projects/427997258929717249

2. Create your own copy by clicking the dropdown arrow in the top-left corner, then ***Save a copy*** followed by ***Save copy***. This ensures your changes won't affect other participants.

Replace **John Doe** and **patient001** with your name and ID.<br/><br/>

5. Launch your simulation by clicking the green "Start the simulation" button. Your patient monitoring dashboard will initialize and display vital signs.

<br/><br/>
These are the different sensors, where you can increase or decrease the simulated vital signs just by moving these knobs clock or anti-clock wise.
