## üõ†Ô∏è Workshop Instructions
### Install Wokwi Private Gateway
To ensure reliable connectivity during the workshop simulation we'll use the Wokwi Private Gateway. To use wokwi private gateway we'll need a paid Wokwi account.
**[NEED TO CHECK IF WE CAN GO WITH CLASSROOM ACCOUNT HERE OR WE GO WITH PUBLC GATEWAY]**

Download and run the appropriate release for your operating system from: https://github.com/wokwi/wokwigw/releases

If you see this the we are good and gateway is running on your system.

### Simulation Setup
1. Open the Wokwi project: Patient Monitor Simulation: https://wokwi.com/projects/427997258929717249

2. On the top-left side, click on the drop-down arrow and the "**Save a copy**" then "**Save copy**" button to create a new copy for you. We are doing this so that our changes don't effect other participants.
